          <strong>Neuroplasticity.</strong>
          <p>
            Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to create, reform and
            strengthen neural pathways, and it is the process in which permanent
            learning takes place.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you learn something new or form a new memory, the brain creates
            neural pathways connecting cells. It benefits people by enabling
            them to learn new things and ‘rewire’ their brain to adapt to new
            ideas, ways of living or to recover from injury. By doing, or even
            just thinking, you can strengthen these neural pathways. Studies
            have shown that by thinking about something, such as playing the
            piano, one can improve their ability to play at a similar (though
            slighter lesser) rate to those that physically practise. This is
            because thinking still ignites the neural pathways and strengthens
            it so that it will not be ‘broken’, or forgotten, easily. As the
            saying often goes “practice makes perfect”.
          </p>
          <p>The five principles of of neuroplasticity are:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <em>Challenge and Novelty:</em> It must be new and challenging.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Intention:</em> It must have meaning, relevance or importance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Specific Attention:</em> It must focus on an exact tasks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Repetition:</em> Repition and practise makes perfect.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Time:</em> Learning new things takes practise, patience and
              time.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Lets go into a little more depth on the principle of repetition. The
            idea behind repetition is that neural pathways that are not actively
            engaged will shrink and eventually break, so that you can no longer
            recall it. It must be actively engaged inorder to strengthen it.
            This is why repetition is so important.
          </p>
          <p>
            A technique for aiding the process of committing something to your
            permanent memory is to link what you’ve just learned with something
            you already know. For instance, you may learn that the musical note
            c sharp (c#) creates a high pitched sound. If you link this new
            knowledge to your pre-existing that a sharp noise tends to be high
            pitched, you will find it easier to commit it to memory. This is
            because when one neural link is triggered, it can trigger other
            neural pathways too. Thus practice, repetition and linking new
            knowledge to older knowledge improves neuroplasticity.

          <strong>A Growth Mindset.</strong>
          <p>
            A growth mindset is the belief that talents can be developed through
            hard work, good strategies and feedback. People with a growth
            mindset tend to put more emphasis on improving their skills, and
            thus achieve more than people with a fixed mindset. A fixed mindset
            is the belief that one’s abilities, intelligence and talents are
            fixed and cannot be improved upon. People with a fixed mindset tend
            to put their focus on trying to look smart, rather than on improving
            their skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dwerk states that to achieve a growth mindset one must recognise
            that they also have a fixed mindset, because a pure growth mindset
            does not exist. To improve your growth mindset you must give praise
            and reward to yourself and others for effort, learning, progress and
            for the process you used to get there. An example of these processes
            would be seeking help from others, trying new things, and learning
            from setbacks. By integrating these things into your learning
            journey you can culture a growth mindset.
