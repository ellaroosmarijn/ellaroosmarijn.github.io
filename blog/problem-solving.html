          <strong>When I Got Stuck on a Simple Problem.</strong>
          <p>
            This week I got stuck on a simple problem because I failed to take a
            break. I'd just started on a challenge that asked us to add a 'key'
            called children to a code that we were writing. Instead of creating
            a the key, I thought it was asking us to create a child class to the
            code. I know you can add a class in HTML, but I'm not sure if yu can
            in Javascript, so I ended up going around in circles, until I took a
            break and came back to it with fresh eyes. By doing this I was able
            to properly break down what was beinhg asked of me and realised my
            mistake earlier.

          <strong>When I Solved a Problem.</strong>
          <p>
            I solved a problem by using the rubber ducky method. This is a
            method where you talk someone or an object (such as a rubber duck)
            through your problem so that you can more clearly understand it and
            see what you've missed. I was working on the Varuiables and Arrays
            challenge and was trying to to understand why my array with a list
            of names wasn't working. I went over it and googld it multiple times
            to no avail. In the end I was going to ask my partner where I went
            wrong, but as I began to explain the issue to him I realised that I
            had forgotten to put quotations around each name. This is important
            because the names are strings, not variables.

            >How Confident Are You With Problem-Solving Techniques?</strong
          >
          <p>
            I feel reasonably confident with the problem-solving techniques of
            just trying somethning and working from there, the rubber ducky
            method, and googling. I feel somewhat confident with console.logging
            and reading error messages, but feel that more practise will still
            be very beneficial. I'm somewhat confident confident with
            pseudocoding, however it feels unnatural so it's not my first port
            of call. I don't feel confident with asking my peers for help.
