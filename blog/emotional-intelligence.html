          <h3><strong>What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong></h3>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence (EQ) is the ability to pay attention to the
            present moment by identifying and regulating emotions, understanding
            the emotions of others, and expressing curiosity and a willingness
            to learn. In short, EQ is the ability to perceive, use, understand,
            manage and handle emotions in the present moment. There are many
            important benefits to strengthening your EQ, including help building
            relationships, reducing stress, defusing conflict, and improving job
            satisfaction. EQ is not something that people are born with, it is a
            characteristic that we learn and strengthen. This can be done
            through mindfulness, self-awareness, sensitivity to others, and
            conscious listening.

          </h3>
          <p>
            Intelligence Quotient (IQ) assesses an individual's human
            intelligence by measuring their ability to solve problems, use
            logic, and understand complex ideas. It is helpful for academic
            work, but does not improve emotional regulation or building
            relationships. On the other hand, EQ assesses an individual's
            ability to regulate and understand emotions, and use that knowledge
            to inform decisions. IQ assesses intellect, while EQ assesses
            emotional intellect.

          <h3><strong>Why is Emotional Intelligence Important?</strong></h3>
          <p>
            As stated earlier, EQ has many benefits. Let's go through a few of
            them.
          </p>
          <strong>Reduces Stress.</strong>
          <p>
            EQ can help with reducing stress. Individuals that can recognise and
            manage their reactions to other peoples emotions and their own
            feelings can respond to them positively by staying calm and taking a
            more objective view of the situation. In a work environment this is
            a particularly important benefit of EQ, because it helps teams work
            together under stress.
          </p>
          <strong
            >Improves Reaction to Receiving Constructive Criticism.</strong
          >
          <p>
            Being aware of your emotions and controlling them enables
            individuals to react positively to constructive criticism.
            Constructive criticism can be difficult to hear, and may make people
            defensive because they are responding emotionally. It can create a
            hostile atmosphere. Through emotional awareness a positive reaction
            and atmosphere can be maintained.
          </p>
          <strong>Improves Communication and Defuses Conflict.</strong>
          <p>
            Sometimes tension begins to build either at home, in the workplace,
            or at school and individuals can struggle to manage their emotions.
            This may result in an emotionally driven response, which can have a
            negative impact on the situation at hand. However, with higher EQ
            the individual would have recognised how they were feeling, took
            responsibility for it, and calmly communicated what they needed to.
            This can be the first step to resolving conflict.
          </p>
          <strong>Fosters Better Leadership.</strong>
          <p>
            Using their EQ, leaders can understand their team's emotions and
            responses more efficiently. This may mean identifying positive and
            negative motivators for each team member, and for the team as a
            whole. This would positively impact the team's engagement and
            productivity.
