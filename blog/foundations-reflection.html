          </strong>
          <p>
            I have learned that I have a mix of a growth and fixed mindset and
            that it is something I really want to keep improving), that I really
            will keep persevering when things are hard, and that through the
            five rules of neuroplasticity I can improve my memory and learning
            abilities.

            >What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in
            learning and programming?
          </strong>
          <p>
            The role of values in learning and programming is that they can
            guide how one acts in different scenarios. For instance, if a
            student or programmer is very stuck on a task they would give up if
            they didn’t value challenges and perseverance.
          </p>

          <p>
            Empathy has a strong role in learning and programming, because it
            dictates how aware you are of other people and team environments.
            People with more empathy, or a higher EQ, can really improve team
            dynamics.
          </p>

          <p>
            I think that self-awareness ties into both values and empathy. It is
            linked to values because if one is self-aware of their values and
            how they respond in difficult scenarios they can more easily
            navigate through them. Moreover, if one is self-aware they may be
            more inclined to notice when empathy is important or positively
            impactful in a given scenario.

            What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
          </strong>
          <p>
            I have been somewhat surprised by just how intertwined the core
            learning is with the tech learning. I knew that EQ was important and
            linked in, but I didn’t realise how impactful a growth mindset and
            neuroplasticity was on learning in general.

            What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
          </strong>
          <p>
            For me, the most challenging aspects of the core learning was
            writing down and sharing in a publicly accessible place my values
            and examples of them in play. I don’t mind discussing these things
            with someone, but writing them down feels very permanent and I feel
            as though I have little control over who I share it with, and thus
            who gets to know something about me. I’m a reasonably private
            person, so sharing these things was a challenge.
