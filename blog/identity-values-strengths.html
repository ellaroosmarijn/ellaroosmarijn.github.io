            Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the

          <p>
            We are faced with ethical decisions regularly throughout our lives.
            Sometimes we make the right decision, and sometimes we don’t.
            Whenever I come across an ethical decision I try to look inwards and
            reflect back on my personal values.
          </p>
          <p>
            An example of a recent ethical decision I was faced with was a
            decision I made with my partner. My partner had a beautiful
            working-line black German Shepherd called Juno, who we both loved
            very much. She was roughly a year old when we decided that we wanted
            to move overseas (to Holland) in a couple of years and travel around
            the world. We realised that this would be very difficult with a
            working-line German Shepherd, especially if we lived in an apartment
            in the central city. We thought that taking her with us would be
            extremely unfair, particularly when we move into an apartment with
            no outdoor space. We tried to weigh up our options to try to make it
            work, for instance we considered the possibility that we could both
            be able to take her out for a couple of hours a day, but quickly
            realised that with both of us working and studying full time it
            would be too much and wouldn't be fair on her. Upon realising that
            she wouldn’t fit into our future lives very easily we made the
            decision to pass her onto a family that had children to entertain
            her and an outdoor space to let her run around in. Making this
            decision was heart-breaking, particularly for my partner, but we
            both believe that it was the right thing to do for her.

          <p>
            I believe that the people around you influence who you are and what
            you value. Over the past few years I have been working on
            surrounding myself with people who are positive, honest,
            trustworthy, and hard-working. Since making this change I found that
            these values became even more important to me, and something that I
            will always firmly stand by. Moreover, surrounding myself with
            people encouraged me to act out those values and work harder than
            ever, which definitely showed in my study and day-to-day life.

            Determined and driven. Once I set my sights on something I will work
            relentlessly to get there, although I am still very flexible if
            things change. An example of this would be when I skipped my last
            year of highschool to attend the University of Auckland and graduate
            by 19.

            In Big 5 tests I tend to score quite high in conscientiousness and
            open mindedness. I view this as a strength, because it means that I
            am very open to new ideas and learning new things. Attending Dev
            Academy is an example of this. Towards the end of my degree I was
            preparing to do a research masters in political conflict resolution
            and governance. As part of my preparation I wanted to upskill and
            learn how to handle data effectively, so I taught myself PostgreSQL
            - I find learning new things is very exciting. To say that I really
            enjoyed it would be an understatement, and it is what led me to
            decide to pursue a career in tech. This change in career path and
            openness to learning something new is an example of my open
            mindedness.

          <p>
            As I mentioned above, I am a very driven and determined person. This
            comes with many benefits but also has a couple downsides. The main
            downside for me used to be that I would move very quickly. Whilst I
            may have gotten a lot done in the day, it did mean that sometimes I
            would miss a small detail and have to take a little extra time to go
            back and fix it or re-read the instructions. I’ve found that this
            hasn’t impacted my learning journey too much, although it has meant
            that I’ve had to learn to slow down and take my time.

          <p>
            While I was studying at the University of Auckland I worked part
            time in sales at a high end retail store. There were many jobs to be
            done throughout the day, which I really enjoyed because I like to
            stay busy. Unfortunately my manager would take advantage of that and
            push most of the jobs onto me, even if it was a job for two people.
            I approached my manager on the subject, but found that he only
            pulled his weight for a short period before reverting back to giving
            me most of the work. When it was clear that approaching him didn’t
            work I began writing a job list for myself every morning, so it was
            harder for him to give me more work. If he tried to add more to my
            list, I would either accept the jobs or tell him that I didn’t have
            time. I found that this was an effective method because he could
            more clearly see how much I was taking on and he couldn’t justify
            giving me more. Because of this I had more control over my day and
            my workload.
