          <h3><strong>JavaScript in Relation to HTML and CSS.</strong></h3>
          <strong>What is Javascript?</strong>
          <p>
            Javascript is a programming language that is used to create
            interactive effects on the web and to build web-based applications.
            In short, Javascript adds behaviour to websites.
          </p>
          <strong>The Relationship Between Javascript, HTML and CSS.</strong>
          <p>
            HTML is the ‘bones’ or structure of a webpage. On its own it
            prepares the content of a webpage with no formatting. CSS then
            formats and styles the HTML content, to make a more user friendly
            interface. Javascript is a third and very important layer of a
            webpage. Javascript allows the webpage to be interactive with the
            user by returning a value or change according to the set action.
            Without Javascript a webpage created solely from HTML and CSS may be
            less engaging with the user due to a less responsive design.
          </p>
          <strong
            >What is an Analogy for the Relationship Between Javascript, HTML
            and CSS?</strong
          >
          <p>
            An analogy for this relationship would be that of the human body.
            The HTML would be the skeleton, since it forms the bones of the
            webpage. CSS would be the skin because it provides styling and
            formatting that make the webpage more appealing to a user, just as
            skin can change how someone looks. Javascript would be the muscles
            because it adds behaviour and interactive features to a website,
            like muscles provide movement and behaviour in people.

          <h3><strong>Control Flow and Loops.</strong></h3>
          <strong>What is Control Flow?</strong>
          <p>
            Control flow in programming is the order in which statements and
            functions must be made. This is because a function cannot be called
            before it has been defined, just as you would name a puppy before
            trying to call it over to you. Control flow allows for the developer
            to choose which sections of code to run and when. An example of
            control flow in coding would be:
          </p>
          <!-- prettier-ignore -->
          <code>
function eatPie(pie) { 
  if (pie <= 10) {
    text = “Eat pies!”;
  } else {
    text = “Too many pies to eat!”; 
  } 
}
          </code>

          <p>
            Here, the function <code>eatPie</code> has been defined, which means
            that if we want to ‘call’ the function (have it shown on the
            webpage) we can call it after this function. The next part of the
            code is the <code>if-else</code> statement. The if else statement is
            telling the computer which code to run and when. So if there are ten
            or more pies, the webpage will show the text
            <code>“Eat pies!”</code>. The ‘else’ part of the
            <code>if-else</code> statement tells the computer that
            <em>only</em> if there are more than ten pies to show the text
            <code>“Too many pies to eat!”</code>.
          </p>
          <strong>What is a Loop?</strong>
          <p>
            A loop is typically written in Javascript and is a sequence of code
            or instructions that are repeated until a condition has been met.
            Generally a loop runs a specific number of times, or until it has
            found or changed specific data that was predefined. An everyday
            example of a loop is when you shop with a grocery list. A grocery
            list could be considered as an array (a collection of items) that
            the shopper must read through to check off every item. The action of
            the shopper checking the list repeatedly is like a loop that will
            only cease to occur when there are no items left on the list. An
            example of a loop would be written as:
          </p>
          <!-- prettier-ignore -->
          <code>
function groceryList(‘apples’, ‘bread, ‘milk’) {
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) { 
   console.log(groceryList[i])
  } 
}
          </code>
          <p>
            Here, the funcion <code>groceryList</code> has an array (list) of
            food items as a parameter. It will begin at the first item (as
            indicated by <code>i = 0</code>) and continue through each item in
            numerical order (as indicated by <code>i++</code>) until it reaches
            the third and last item (as indicated by <code>i < 3</code>). This
            is essentially the written version of what someone would do when
            they go through their grocery list at the supermarket.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since repetitive tasks are reasonably common in programming, loops
            become important for minimising the chance of bugs and saving time
            by only writing a task once.
          </p>

          <h3><strong>What are Functions and Why Are They Helpful?</strong></h3>
          <strong>What is a Function?</strong>
          <p>
            Essentially every programming language lets you create ‘blocks’ of
            code that perform specific tasks. The blocks of code are called
            functions. They are helpful because they enable a developer to write
            a function once and recall it in multiple places on the file.
            Additionally, it helps with breaking a larger set of instructions or
            tasks into smaller chunks. A function can be written as:
          </p>
          <!-- prettier-ignore -->
          <code>
function goodMorning(name) { 
  return ‘Good morning ’ + name 
} 

let goodMorningResult = goodMorning(‘Maye’)
          </code>
          <p>
            Here, the function is <code>goodMorning</code> that has a parameter
            of a name. The name is defined at the bottom of the code a ‘Maye’,
            although any name can be entered here. The function will then return
            the text “Good morning Maye”.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3><strong>Arrays and Objects.</strong></h3>
          <strong>What is an Array?</strong>
          <p>
            An array is a data structure consisting of a collection of items
            (e.g. variables or values). In an array each item of data has an
            index number which starts at zero. For instance, in the image below
            the array contains the values <code>[73, 98, 86, 61, 96]</code>. In
            this array <code>73</code> has an index number of 0.
          </p>
          <img
            src="https://www.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/9781449356835/files/figs/cspr_0601.png"
            alt="Array image"
            width="250px"
          />
          <p>
            You can access the data in an array by referring to its index number
            <code>i = 3</code>, like in the earlier example of the code for a
            loop. On the other hand, accessing data from an object is a very
            different process.
          </p>
          <strong>What is an Object?</strong>
          <p>
            An object is a key value storage structure with ‘prototypical
            inheritance’ where if a key is not on an object, it will check if
            the key is on a parent. An object can inherit methods and values
            from another object. To access an object you need a variable with a
            reference that contains the object. From here you can either use the
            dot notation or the bracket notation. Let’s say that we wanted to
            find the length of the object:
          </p>
          <!-- prettier-ignore -->
          <code>
            let names = [‘Maye’, ‘Freya’, ‘Noah’]
          </code>
          <p>
            With dot notation you would use <code>names.length</code>, and with
            bracket notation you would use <code>names[length]</code>. In this
            scenario the code would return a value of three, because there are
            three values.
          </p>

          <h3><strong>The Dom.</strong></h3>
          <strong>An Explanation of the DOM.</strong>
          <p>
            DOM stands for document object model, and can be thought of as an
            object representation of your entire html document. This is how the
            dom views your document:
          </p>
          <img
            src="https://www.kirupa.com/html5/images/DOM_js_72.png"
            alt="DOM's view of a document."
            width="250px"
          />
          <p>Let's break down the diagram above.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Window</em> - The window object has a relationship with the
              document, because it deals with the browser window. The document
              operates off the widow object, and deals with everything that
              lives in the document, as shown in the diagram above.
            </li>
            <li><em>Document</em> - The DOM describes the document.</li>
            <li>
              <em>Node</em> - Every object located within a document is a type
              of node. Nodes can be elements, attributes, text content,
              comments, document-related stuff, and various other things.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Element</em> - Every element has an html element, which has an
              object representation that backs it. For instance, the
              HTMLBRElement represents the BR tag, the HTMLButtonElement
              represents the button tag, and the HTMLDivElement represents the
              DIV tag.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <strong>The Importance of Elements.</strong>
          <p>
            The object representation that is offered by elements is important
            because it provides access to the elements in JavaScript and allows
            you to read, write, modify, and create elements dynamically. A
            diagram of this relationship between Nodes, elements and HTML
            elements would be drawn as:
          </p>

            alt="Relationship between nodes, elements and HTML elements."

          <strong>Editing in the DOM.</strong>
          <p>
            This piece of code
            <!-- prettier-ignore -->
            <code
              ><a href="index.html" target="_blank">Click this link</a></code
            >
            is represented by four nodes in the DOM.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>The HTMLAnchorElement, which is the parent element.</li>
            <li>
              The HTMLAnchorElement.href (this is an attribute node), which is a
              child node.
            </li>
            <li>
              The HTMLAnchorElement.target (this is also an attribute node),
              which is a child node.
            </li>
            <li>The text node ‘Click this link’, which is a child node.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            To edit the anchor element in the DOM, you will first need to go to
            the document interface. Once you’re in the interface you can use
            either the <code>document.querySelector()</code> to find the first
            selector or the <code>document.querySelectorAll()</code> to find all
            of the selector. In this scenario, we’ll use the
            <code>document.querySelector()</code> since we have written only one
            anchor element. The code should look like this:
          </p>
          <code>let element = document.querySelector(‘a’);</code>
          <p>
            We have now selected the first ‘a’ element. Let’s say that we want
            to change the colour of the link from blue to green. To do this, we
            will use the <code>HTMLElement.style</code> property to change the
            CSS on the HTML anchor tag. This specific tag is used because the
            anchor tag is a child of the HTMLElement node, and will inherit its
            properties. The <code>.style.color</code> is added to the
            <code>HTMLElement</code> to reference the CSS (style) and that we
            want the colour to change (.color). The code for changing the colour
            should look like this:
          </p>
          <code>element.style.color = ‘green’;</code>
          <p>
            If we had more than one anchor element we could have used the
            <code>document.querySelectorAll()</code> to change all of the anchor
            element’s colours from blue to green.
