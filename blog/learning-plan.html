            <strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong>
            <p>
              My long term goal is to help people in need, and support charities
              and their causes. I believe that we can make a difference through
              coming together as a collective. I believe that I can make a
              contribution through software development. In the nearer future I
              aim to join a like-minded and hardworking team, where we can work
              together to learn and grow.

              >What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be
              in Bootcamp?
            </strong>
            <p>
              In Bootcamp I think my biggest strength will be my determination.
              When I set my mind to something I will work very hard to complete
              it and persevere even when I’m struggling. I think my limitation
              will be that when I get stuck on something it takes me quite a
              while to figure it out. This is mainly because I want to try to
              work it out myself, but I need to remember that I need to draw a
              line at some point.

              >What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at
              Bootcamp will be?
            </strong>
            <p>
              I think my biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be
              pair programming. I tend to get a little self-conscious about my
              abilities, and get ‘stage fright’, where I forget some of the
              things I’ve learned. Although more exposure to pair programming
              will help and over time I will become more comfortable with it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would say that this is the non-technical (human skill) that I
              would like to develop while at Dev Academy.

            <strong>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</strong>
            <p>
              From the Bootcamp team I expect a reasonably quick reply from at
              least one member when asking for help within work hours. I would
              also expect that they create a safe working environment where all
              questions are welcome, and where students can receive respectful
              feedback on their submissions.
            </p>

          <section>
            <strong
              >What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?
            </strong>
            <p>
              My expectations of myself are that I will continue to persevere
              when it is difficult, recognise when it is time to take a step
              back from my work, ask for help when it is really needed, and
              stick to my schedule as much as I can.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to these things I will also continue to follow the set
              of guidelines that I created for myself. These are listed in the
              Foundations Learning Plan Section.

              learning.</strong
            >
            <p>
              I would say that I have two key strengths when it comes to
              learning. The first is that I learn quickly. Once I understand how
              something works and why it is used I tend to be able to implement
              it in my work quite quickly.
              <br />
              My second strength is that I am a very determined and ambitious
              person. For me, this means that once I set a goal I will work very
              hard to get there and will keep persevering even when it's
              difficult. I have demonstrated these learning strengths through my
              past education. For instance, when I was in high school I set
              myself the goal of skipping my last year and going straight to
              university so I could continue my education at a higher level. To
              do this I worked very hard to achieve excellence and university
              entrance.
            </p>
            <p>
              My limitation when it comes to learning is that I am not good at
              leaving a job half finished or incomplete. When I work on a task I
              need to finish it to its full potential and put in my very best
              effort - even if it’s a small task. I see this as a limitation
              because sometimes it means that I spend a bit longer on a task
              than I should. Since starting at Dev Academy I’ve been trying to
              overcome this limitation by remembering that it does not have to
              be perfect and that it’s time to move on to the next task.

            <p>
              I enjoy working in teams, but would like to get more experience in
              it. Hopefully we’ll be working in teams a bit more during the
              bootcamp section of the course.

              >
              <p>
                I have some personal guidelines that I’ve formed over the years
                to help me navigate working in teams, on my own, in the
                workplace and in study spaces. They have helped me work
                respectively, productively, with honesty and integrity, and soak
                up the full benefit of the task.
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Ensure that I am always challenging myself, even if the
                  challenge is small. Reflecting on my workload and regularly
                  assessing where I’m at is important. It means that I can ask
                  for help with a problem, or seek more of a challenge if I need
                  it, to ensure my continual growth. I have found that David
                  Goggins book “Can’t Hurt Me” has given me a lot of inspiration
                  in this area.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Upholding equality in workload according to each person's own
                  capabilities. When studying in a group it is important to
                  remember that dividing the workload evenly doesn’t mean that
                  it is equal. The workload needs to be assessed according to
                  each member's capabilities. This one is really important to
                  keep in mind, since many people struggle with learning
                  difficulties and invisible conditions which can make studying
                  or working more of a challenge.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To cultivate a good community based on honesty and respect.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Giving credit where it is due, supporting each other and
                  always voicing a compliment rather than keeping it to myself.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Extreme ownership is something I’ve come to really value
                  through Jocko Willink’s books, where he talks about the
                  importance of extreme ownership. Extreme ownership is the idea
                  that the leaders and each individual must own their mistakes.
                  I think it is really important in groups that each individual
                  recognises their mistakes and owns them, so they can learn
                  from them and do better next time. Mistakes are just part of
                  the learning process, and we’re co instantly learning.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Remember to enjoy the process, and ups and downs of learning.
                  I don’t want to look back one day and wish that I had spent
                  more time enjoying the ups and downs of the moment, rather
                  than just powering through. This is an important one for me,
                  since I’m not one to slow down and be in the moment.

              >
              <p>
                When the workload and pressure begins to build up, I take a step
                back and look at it more objectively. For me, this means
                recognising how much has been accomplished so far, and then
                breaking what needs to be done into smaller pieces. This
                technique comes back to a little mantra I use: “How do you eat
                an elephant? One bite at a time”. I find that it reminds me that
                everything doesn’t need to be done at once and that it's more
                sustainable to chip away at it piece by piece.

              way.</strong
            >
            <p>
              I have found that my system for overcoming obstacles ensures that
              I seek help, if I need it, before I waste too much time on it. My
              system is as follows:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>Review my work to find the issue.</li>
              <li>
                Understand the issue - this may be a matter of googling or
                reviewing my notes.
              </li>
              <li>
                If there are multiple issues I will begin with the most
                fundamental issue.
              </li>
              <li>
                If I can’t resolve it at the time, then I will go back through
                my notes or google it.
              </li>
              <li>
                If this fails I will ask for help from a facilitator, my peers,
                or my partner.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once solved, I write the issue and solution in my notes to help
                commit it to memory and for future reference if the issue occurs
                again.
              </li>
            </ol>
            To ensure that I still don’t waste too much time, I will allocate a
            rough time limit to try and figure it out before asking for help. I
            adjust that time limit according to how big or complex of an issue
            I’m facing.
