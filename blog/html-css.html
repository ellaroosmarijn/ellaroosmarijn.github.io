          <strong>CSS Positioning.</strong>
          <p>
            The CSS position property defines the location, or position, of an
            element in a document. To determine its final position, one would
            define the offsetting distance from the left, right, top or bottom
            of a position property. The syntax for this is:
            <code>position: relative;</code>, <code>position: absolute;</code>,
            <code>posiiton: fixed;</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            When offsetting, a positive value will move the element inwards, and
            if a negative value is used it will offset the element outwards, as
            shown on the diagram to the right. However, it is important to note
            that without a defined position type, the directional properties
            will have no effect.
          </p>

            width="250px"
          />
          <p>
            Positional properties provide a foundation for the directional
            properties to work with. The following are the five positional
            properties:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Static (default),</li>
            <li>Realtive,</li>
            <li>Absolute,</li>
            <li>Fixed, and</li>
            <li>Sticky.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            This explanation will only discuss relative, absolute and fixed
            positioning.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <strong>Relative Positioning</strong>
          <p>
            Elements with <code>position: realtive;</code> remain in the normal
            flow of the document, so that even once it has been repositioned
            other elemets around it continue to act as though it hasn't moved.
          </p>
          <p>
            To move or offset the element, the left, right, top and bottom
            values are applied. In doing this, the developer will need to
            specify how many pixels (px) the element is to move. It will then
            move according to its original position.
          </p>
          <p>For example, if we had a red box with the original position of</p>
          <code
            >.red-box{ width: 50%; height: 40vh; background: red; position:
            relative; }
          </code>
          <p>then it would look like the image below.</p>
          <img
            src="https://blog.openreplay.com/images/understanding-css-positioning/images/image06.png"
            alt="Realtive positioning original position"
            width="250px"
          />
          <p>
            We can see here that the red box appears in the center of the sreen.
            It would remain in this position ven if we tried to move the element
            by a value of 0 <code>left: 0; top: 0;</code>, it remains at the
            same position. This is because moving by a value of 0 would no
            effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            So what would happen if we modified the positioning so that the code
            looked like:
          </p>
          <code>
            red-box{ width: 50%; height: 40vh; background: red; position:
            relative; left: 120px; top: 120px; }
          </code>
          <p>
            <em
              >Note: the only thing that has changed in the code is
              <code>left: 120px;</code> and <code>top: 120px;</code>.</em
            >
          </p>
          <p>Let's see the changes in the image below:</p>
          <img
            src="https://blog.openreplay.com/images/understanding-css-positioning/images/image07.png"
            alt="Realtive positioning new position"
            width="250px"
          />
          <p>
            We can see that the boxed moved away from it's original position by
            120px from the top and 120px from the left.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <strong>Absolute Positioning</strong>
          <p>
            Elements with <code>position: absolute;</code> are removed from the
            normal flow of the document, so that other elements around it will
            act as though it is no longer there. Absolute elements are
            positioned according to the closest positioned parent (nearest
            containing element with an assigned position). It is important that
            the parent has been positioned using
            <code>position: relative;</code>. If there happens to be no parent,
            then the element will be posiitoned according to the initial
            containing block.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if we set the red box to
            <code>position: relative;</code> and create a new blue box with
            <code>positon: absolute;</code>, so that the new code looks like:
          </p>
          <code>
            .red-box{ display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items:
            center; width: 50%; height: 40vh; background: red; position:
            relative; }
          </code>
          <div>
            <code>
              .blue-box{ background: blue; width: 40%; height: 40%; position:
              absolute; }
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>Then the box positioning would look like the image below:</p>
          <img
            src="https://blog.openreplay.com/images/understanding-css-positioning/images/image08.png"
            alt="Position absolute original position"
            width="250px"
          />
          <p>
            Here we can seee that the blue box has positioned itself with the
            centre of the parent (the red box). This is because no specific
            parametes have been set. Now, let's see what happens when we move
            the blue box by setting a parameter of <code>top: 0;</code>, so that
            the new code looked like:
          </p>
          <code
            >.blue-box{ background: blue; width: 40%; height: 40%; position:
            absolute; top: 0; }
          </code>
          <p>Let's see the changes in the image below:</p>
          <img
            src="https://blog.openreplay.com/images/understanding-css-positioning/images/image09.png"
            alt="Position absolute new position"
            width="250px"
          />
          <p>
            Here we can see that the blue box has moved to the top of the parent
            element (the red box). This is because it has moved according to the
            parent element, so that a top value of 0 positions the blue box's
            top edge with a distance of 0px from the parent's top edge.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <strong>Fixed Positioning</strong>
          <p>
            Like elements with <code>position: absolute;</code>, elements with
            <code>position: fixed;</code> are also removed from the normal flow
            of the document. But unlike the absolute positioning, a fixed
            positon element is positioned relative to the
            <code> html </code> element (the browser window). This means that
            the element will always remain fixed at the specified location,
            regardless of a user scrolling the page. A common example of a fixed
            element is a header on a website that remains in place, even after
            scrolling further down the page. Let's created our own fixed
            element.
          </p>
          <p>
            Begin by setting the blue box to
            <code>position: fixed;</code> and create a new green box with
            <code>positon: relative;</code> to see the effect of the fixed
            position while scrolling. The code should now look like:
          </p>
          <div>
          <code>
            .red-box{ width: 50%; height: 40vh; background: red; position:
            relative; }
          </code>
        </div>
        <div>
          <code>
            .blue-box{ background: blue; width: 20%; height: 20%; position:
            fixed; top: 50px; right: 50px; }
          </code>
        </div>
        <div>
          <code>
            .green-box{ width: 50%; height: 40vh; background: green; position:
            relative; }
          </code>
        </div>
          <p>Let's see the changes in the video below:</p>
          <video width="320" height="240" controls>
            <source
              src="/images/video-fixed-positioning.mov"
              type="video/mp4"
            />
          </video>
          <p>
            Here we can see that the blue box is positioned according to the
            screen and is fixed in that position when you scroll.
          </p>
